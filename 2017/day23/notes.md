h is incremented when:
	f is 0
	
f is set to 0 when
	g is 0
	when d*e-b = 0

### LOOPS

outer b loop
d loop
e loop

### Register Purposes

a = flag
b = looping var
c = upper limit 
d = looping var
e = looping var
f = flag for incrementing h
g = dummy used for calculating 
h = counter we are interested in
